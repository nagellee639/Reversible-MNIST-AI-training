# Reversible-MNIST-AI-training
An attempt to make an AI out of reversible logic gates

This initial attempt was made with assistance of AI, so there may be bugs.

Made for use on linux with an AMD gpu

Modify the CMakeLists.txt for your target gpu (for example, I have a Vega 64, so I set it to gfx900)

just run python setup_gpu.py install --user

then run python train_gpu.py
