# Reversible-MNIST-AI-training
An attempt to make an AI out of simulated reversible logic gates

This initial attempt was made with assistance of AI, so there may be bugs.

Made for use on linux with an AMD gpu

Modify the CMakeLists.txt for your target gpu (for example, I have a Vega 64, so I set it to gfx900)

just run python setup_gpu.py install --user

then run python train_gpu.py


I will soon try to publish an explanation of what exactly I mean by reversible logic gates, as well as my rationale.
